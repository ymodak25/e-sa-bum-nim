That’s a powerful origin story, Yash — and it elevates your project from “a cool script” to “a meaningful, self‑driven solution born from resilience.” Colleges love that combination of personal challenge, reflection, and initiative. The key is to weave your story into the README in a way that feels authentic and motivating without turning it into an essay.

Here’s a polished version of the README that incorporates your journey in a crisp, professional tone while still carrying emotional weight.

# **E‑Sa‑Bum‑Nim 🥋**  
*A Python‑powered Taekwondo form reader and training companion*

## **Overview**
E‑Sa‑Bum‑Nim is a Python‑based tool that reads out Taekwondo forms step‑by‑step, helping practitioners train independently, reinforce memory, and build confidence. It acts as a digital instructor — always ready to guide you through poomsae with clarity and consistency.

## **Why I Built This**
My name is **Yash Modak**, and I’ve been practicing martial arts for over **10 years**. I am a **3rd‑degree black belt in Taekwondo** and a **sophomore at Evergreen Valley High School**.

This project began after a difficult moment in my martial arts journey. In **September 2023**, I appeared for my **2nd Dan test**. Unlike 1st Dan, where you earn your black belt, 2nd Dan marks the point where you begin assisting and teaching at your dojang — and the expectations rise sharply. I didn’t fully understand how high that bar was, and because I didn’t have all **15 forms** fully memorized, I made mistakes. When I learned I hadn’t passed, I was devastated.

Around that same time, I had started exploring computer science and learning Python. Instead of letting the setback define me, I decided to combine my two passions — technology and Taekwondo — to solve the exact problem that held me back. That idea became **E‑Sa‑Bum‑Nim**.

I used this tool to prepare for my retest one month later, and the difference was dramatic. I walked in confident, focused, and fully prepared. I passed with ease. Later, during my **3rd Dan test**, I relied on this program again to perfect new forms and refine older ones. Today, I use it regularly to run through my forms anytime, anywhere.

E‑Sa‑Bum‑Nim isn’t just a project — it’s the tool I wish I had earlier, and now I’m making it available to anyone who wants to train smarter.

## **Features**
- 🔊 **Audio read‑outs** of Taekwondo form steps  
- 🧩 **Modular design** for adding new forms  
- 🐍 **Simple Python interface** for running and customizing sessions  
- 🎯 **Built for real training**, not just demonstration  
- 💻 **Open‑source and extensible** for future development  

## **Getting Started**
Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ymodak25/e-sa-bum-nim
cd e-sa-bum-nim
```

Run the program:

```bash
python main.py

(Adjust the command based on your file structure.)

## **Future Plans**
- Add more forms and variations  
- Introduce pacing and timing controls  
- Explore pose‑estimation integration for accuracy scoring  
- Build a more polished user interface
